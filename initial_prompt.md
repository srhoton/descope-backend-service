We need to build a quarkus application that exposes a REST endpoint to manage a list of units. It will sit behind an ALB and will use DynamoDB as the data store. A unit can just have an id and a name. The application should support the following operations:

- Create a unit
- Get a unit by id
- Update a unit by id
- Delete a unit by id

Here is a simple Quarkus application that exposes a REST endpoint to manage a list of units using DynamoDB as the data store. Please ask me any questions you have about the implementation.
